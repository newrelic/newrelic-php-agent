/*
 * Purpose : Convert an integer to a base-10 string.
 *
 * Params  : 1. The destination buffer.
 *           2. The length of the buffer, in bytes.
 *           3. The value to format.
 *
 * Notes   : The caller is responsible for ensuring that the buffer has
 *           sufficient space. Otherwise, truncation may occur.

/*
 * Purpose : Format double precision numbers.
 *
 * Params  : 1. The buffer to write into
 *           2. The length of the buffer
 *           3. The double to format.
 *
 * Returns : 1. Returns the number of bytes (not including the nul-terminator)
 *              written to the buffer.  Returns -1 on error.  Note that this
 *              behavior does not match snprintf.

extern int nr_double_to_str(char* buf, int buf_len, double input);

/*
 * Purpose : Scan double precision numbers, following strtod, but only accepting
 * '.' as a decimal point.
 *
 * Params  : 1. The buffer to scan.
 *           2. A reference to a pointer that will be set pointing to the first
 * nonscanned character.
 *
 * It is undefined what is returned if the contents of buf denotes a
 * NaN or Infinity. The input must use '.' as the decimal point. The C
 * library strtod is used to do the conversion to achieve conversion
 * accuracy, with appropriate manipulation of the input to accomodate
 * the locale sensitivity of strtod.
