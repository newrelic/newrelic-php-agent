# New Relic PHP Agent

The [New Relic APM PHP Agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php) monitors your application to help you identify and solve performance issues. The PHP agent consists of a PHP extension (which collects data from your application) and a local proxy daemon (which transmits the data to New Relic).

![PHP Agent Architecture](docs/img/PHP_Agent_Architecture.png)

## Installation

The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP releases, PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. Prior to installation, please ensure your system meets the [compatibility requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements).

To get started with installation, see the PHP Agent [install](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-overview) documentation. The PHP Agent pre-built package includes the interactive [`newrelic-install`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/using-newrelic-install-script) script, which automates some installation tasks. Also, see our [advanced installation documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent) for Docker (or other container) installation.

## Getting Started

See our [Introduction to New Relic for PHP](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php) to learn how to use the PHP agent with your application.

## Building and Testing

For instructions on how to build and test the agent, please see our [development guide](/docs/development.md).

## Support

Should you need assistance with New Relic products, you are in good hands with several support diagnostic tools and support channels.

This [troubleshooting framework](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/php-troubleshooting-framework-install/108683) steps you through common troubleshooting questions.

New Relic offers NRDiag, a [client-side diagnostic utility](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) that automatically detects common problems with New Relic agents. If NRDiag detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. For customers with a New Relic Support Plan, NRDiag can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket.

If the issue has been confirmed as a bug or is a Feature request, please file a Github issue.
