# Dockerized development environment for the New Relic PHP Agent

The dockerized development environment prototype allows contributors to both develop and test (using unit tests AND integration tests) without having to set up a specific environment on their own system.  Integration tests require  a valid New Relic license key. Sign up at https://newrelic.com/signup for a free account.

*PLEASE NOTE* While this is now usable, this is still a work in progress.

docker-compose spins up `mysql` and `redis` and other databases in separate containers.

Two environment variables to note:
`NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY` is required to run the integration tests and should be set to your NR license key.
If your collector isn’t the default (collector.newrelic.com), set the `NEWRELIC_COLLECTOR_HOST` to the appropriate value.

PHP_VER can also be set to vary the PHP version being used.

Set all environment variables prior to running the development environment.  

## Options for using the environment

## With a shell environment

To start the dev environment type `make dev-shell`.  This will create a set of docker containers.
A prompt will open and you’ll be able to compile and run all `make` commands right away with no additional setup (for example: `make -j4 all` or `make -j4 valgrind` or `make -j4 run_tests`).

After compiling the agent, the integration tests can be run using the `integration_runner`.

To run all integration tests, from the prompt, run: `./bin/integration_runner -agent ./agent/.libs/newrelic.so`

To run `redis` only: `./bin/integration_runner -agent ./agent/.libs/newrelic.so -pattern tests/integration/redis/*`

To end the session type `exit`.  You can run `make dev-stop` to stop the docker-compose containers.

In the shell, you can run all `make` commands as you normally would.

## Build only

`make dev-build`

## Unit Tests only

`make dev-unit tests`

## Integration Tests only

`make dev-integration-tests`

## Build and test all

`make dev-all`

## Stop all containers

`make dev-stop`

# Next steps and issues

## There is possibly some incompatibility with mysql in the main build container as one of the mysql unit tests fails.  Unless this is resolved, It might make sense at a future point to have the integration tests run from a different container than the build container.
