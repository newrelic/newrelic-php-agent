/*DESCRIPTION
Test that Supportability metrics: library/cakephp-log/detected and 
Logging/PHP/cakephp-log/disabled metrics are created when cakephp-log 
library is detected.
This test is a mock composer project that uses a logging library as if it
were installed by composer. The library itself is a mock.
