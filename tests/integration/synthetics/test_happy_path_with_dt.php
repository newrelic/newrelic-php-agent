/*DESCRIPTION
The agent should put the Synthetics metadata into the transaction trace
and the transaction event when a valid synthetics header is received.
Additionally, ensure a transaction trace is recorded regardless of the
trace threshold. With DT enabled, DT as well as Synthetics attributes have to
be added.
*/

/*
 * The synthetics header contains the following.
 *   [
 *     1,
 *     432507,
 *     "rrrrrrr-rrrr-1234-rrrr-rrrrrrrrrrrr",
 *     "jjjjjjj-jjjj-1234-jjjj-jjjjjjjjjjjj",
 *     "mmmmmmm-mmmm-1234-mmmm-mmmmmmmmmmmm"
