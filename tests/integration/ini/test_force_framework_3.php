/*DESCRIPTION
Force framework to cakephp, which was apparently skipped in the original code to
map newrelic.framework names to enums.
*/

/*INI
newrelic.framework = cakephp
*/

/*XFAIL
CakePHP is treated as a special framework for detection purposes. Forcing a
special framework does not cause a metric to be generated like normal
frameworks. Instead, the identifying file for the framework must be loaded,
which causes the metric to be generated.
