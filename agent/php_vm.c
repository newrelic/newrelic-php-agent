 *           This function is written unusually for our code base: it uses the
 *           EXPECTED and UNEXPECTED macros heavily.
 *
 *           The reason here is performance: without wanting to re-establish the
 *           worst excesses of our old nr_php_execute_*() family of functions,
 *           this is on a hot path in the PHP 7 agent (every function call --
 *           internal or user function alike -- goes through here), and we want
 *           to minimise our overhead. Where there's a normal case, branch
 *           prediction macros are used to (hopefully) speed up execution by
 *           reducing the likelihood of a branch misprediction stall.
 *
 *           The logic here is fundamentally fairly simple: If the
 *           cufa_callback global is set, then we're instrumenting
 *           call_user_func_array() and should invoke it (provided we can pull
 *           the fields we need out of execute_data). After that, regardless of
 *           whether cufa_callback was set, we should invoke any previous
 *           opcode handler for the same opcode, otherwise return
 *           ZEND_USER_OPCODE_DISPATCH to the Zend Engine, which signals that
 *           the Zend Engine should execute the opline normally.

   * To actually determine whether this is a call_user_func_array() call we

   * the first opcode in an op array -- minimally, there is always at least a
   * ZEND_INIT_FCALL before it -- so this is safe.
   *
   * When PHP 7 flattens a call_user_func_array() call into direct opcodes, it
   * uses ZEND_SEND_ARRAY to send the arguments in a single opline, and that
   * opcode is the opcode before the ZEND_DO_FCALL. Therefore, if we see
   * ZEND_SEND_ARRAY, we know it's call_user_func_array(). The relevant code
   * can be found at:
   * https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.0.19/Zend/zend_compile.c#L3082-L3098
   * https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.1.5/Zend/zend_compile.c#L3564-L3580
   *
   * In PHP 8, a ZEND_CHECK_UNDEF_ARGS opcode is added after the call to
   * ZEND_SEND_ARRAY and before ZEND_DO_FCALL so we need to look back two opcodes
   * instead of just one.
   *
   * Note that this heuristic will fail if the Zend Engine ever starts
   * compiling flattened call_user_func_array() calls differently. PHP 7.2 made a
   * change, but it only optimized array_slice() calls, which as an internal
   * function won't get this far anyway.) We can disable this behaviour by setting
   * the ZEND_COMPILE_NO_BUILTINS compiler flag, but since that will cause
   * additional performance overhead, this should be considered a last resort.
