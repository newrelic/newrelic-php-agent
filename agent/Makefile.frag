# Dependency handling. This is much more complicated than in other parts of the
# agent because PHP's build system uses libtool, which means that the normal .d
# files that gcc/clang generate with -MMD -MP can't be used directly, as the
# rules they define target .libs/foo.o, whereas the Makefile rules libtool
# generates only builds those files as side effects of building foo.lo.
#
# To get around this, we'll take the .d files, use sed to transform the top
# level target each of them defines to match the libtool .lo target, and then
# include the generated file.
#
# We generate the file in .libs so that "make clean" will remove it
# automatically.
