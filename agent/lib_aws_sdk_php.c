/*
 * The ideal file to begin immediate detection of the aws-sdk is:
 * aws-sdk-php/src/functions.php
 * Unfortunately, Php8.2+ and composer autoload leads to the
 * file being optimized directly and not loaded.
 *
 * Options considered:
 *
 * 1. for PHP8.2, and only optimizable libraries, when encountering autoload.php
 * files, ask the file what includes it added and check against only the
 * optimizable library. Small overhead incurred when encountering an autoload
 * file, but detects aws-sdk-php immediately before any sdk code executes
 * (changes needed for this are detailed in the original PR)
 * 2. use a file that gets called later and only when AwsClient.php file is
 * called. It's called later and we'll miss some instrumentation, but if we're
 * only ever going to be interested in Client calls anyway, maybe that's ok?
 * Doesn't detect Sdk.php (optimized out) so when customers only use that or
 * when they use it first, we will not instrument it. This only detects when a
 * Client is called to use a service so potentially misses out on other
 * instrumentation and misses out when customers use the aws-sdk-php but use
 * non-SDK way to interact with the service (possibly with redis/memcached).
 * This way is definitely the least complex and lowest overhead and less
 * complexity means lower risk as well.
 * 3. Directly add the wrappers to the hash map. With potentially 50ish clients
 * to wrap, this will add overhead to every hash map lookup. Currently
 * implemented option is 2, use the AwsClient.php as this is our main focus.
 * This means until a call to an Aws/AwsClient function,
 * all calls including aws\sdk calls are ignored.
 *
 * Version detection will be called directly from Aws\Sdk.php
