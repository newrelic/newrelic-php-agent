 * In a normal course of events, the following line will always work
 * zend_eval_string("Aws\\Sdk::VERSION;", &retval, "Get AWS Version")
 * By the time we have detected the existence of the aws-sdk-php and with
 * default composer profject settings, it callable even from
 * nr_aws_sdk_php_enable which will automatically load the class if it isn't
 * loaded yet and then evaluate the string. However, in the rare case that files
 * are not loaded via autoloader and/or have non-default composer classload
 * settings, if the class is not found, PHP 8.2+ will generate a fatal
 * unrecoverable uncatchable error error whenever it cannot find a class. While
 * calling this from nr_aws_sdk_php_enable would have been great and would allow
 * the sdk version value to be set only once, to avoid the very unlikely but not
 * impossible fatal error, this will be called from the
 * "Aws\\ClientResolver::_apply_user_agent" wrapper which GUARANTEES that
 * aws/sdk exists and is already loaded.
 *
 *
 * Additionally given that aws-sdk-php is currently detected from the
 * AwsClient.php file, this method will always be called when a client is
 * created unlike Sdk::construct which doesn't show with PHP 8.2+.
 *
 * Using Aws/Sdk::__construct for version is currently nonviable as it is
 * unreliable as a version determiner.
 * Having separate functionality to extract from Aws/Sdk::__construct
 * is both not required and is redundant and causes additional overhead and
 * so only one function is needed to extract version.
 *
 * Aws\\ClientResolver::_apply_user_agent a reliable function as it is
 * always called on client initialization since it is key to populating
 * the request headers, and it loads Sdk by default.
 *
 * Concerns about future/past proofing to the checking prioritized the following
 * implementation vs using the eval method.

 * The ideal file to begin immediate detection of the aws-sdk is:
 * aws-sdk-php/src/functions.php
 * Unfortunately, Php8.2+ and composer autoload leads to the
 * file being optimized directly and not loaded.
 *
 * Options considered:
 *
 * 1. for PHP8.2, and only optimizable libraries, when encountering autoload.php
 * files, ask the file what includes it added and check against only the
 * optimizable library. Small overhead incurred when encountering an autoload
 * file, but detects aws-sdk-php immediately before any sdk code executes
 * (changes needed for this are detailed in the original PR)
 * 2. use a file that gets called later and only when AwsClient.php file file is
 * called. It's called later and we'll miss some instrumentation, but if we're
 * only ever going to be interested in Client calls anyway, maybe that's ok?
 * Doesn't detect Sdk.php (optimized out) so when customers only use that or
 * when they use it first, we will not instrument it. This only detects when a
 * Client is called to use a service so potentially misses out on other
 * instrumentation and misses out when customers use the aws-sdk-php but use
 * non-SDK way to interact with the service (possibly with redis/memcached).
 * This way is definitely the least complex and lowest overhead and less
 * complexity means lower risk as well.
 * 3. Directly add the wrappers to the hash map. With potentially 50ish clients
 * to wrap, this will add overhead to every hash map lookup. Currently
 * implemented option is 2, use the AwsClient.php as this is our main focus.
 * This means until a call to an Aws/AwsClient function,
 * all calls including aws\sdk calls are ignored.  Version detection will be
 * tied to Aws/ClientResolver::_apply_user_agent which is ALWAYS called when
 * dealing with aws clients.  It will not be computed from
 * Aws/Sdk::__constructor which would at best be duplicate info and worst would
 * never be ignored until a client is called.
