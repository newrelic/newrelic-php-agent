/*
 * Version specific metadata that we have to gather before we call the original
 * execute_ex handler, as different versions of PHP behave differently in terms
 * of what you can do with the op array after making that call. This structure
 * and the functions immediately below are helpers for
 * nr_php_execute_enabled(), which is the user function execution function.
 *
 * In PHP 7, it is possible that the op array will be destroyed if the function
 * being called is a __call() magic method (in which case a trampoline is
 * created and destroyed). We increment the reference counts on the scope and
 * function strings and keep pointers to them in this structure, then release
 * them once we've named the trace node and/or metric (if required).
 *
 * In PHP 5, execute_data->op_array may be set to NULL if we make a subsequent
 * user function call in an exec callback (which occurs before we decide
 * whether to create a metric and/or trace node), so we keep a copy of the
 * pointer here. The op array itself won't be destroyed from under us, as it's
 * owned by the request and not the specific function call (unlike the
 * trampoline case above).
 *
 * Note that, while op arrays are theoretically reference counted themselves,
 * we cannot take the simple approach of incrementing that reference count due
 * to not all Zend Engine functions using init_op_array() and
 * destroy_op_array(): one example is that PHP 7 trampoline op arrays are
 * simply emalloc() and efree()'d without even setting the reference count.
 * Therefore we have to be more selective in our approach.
